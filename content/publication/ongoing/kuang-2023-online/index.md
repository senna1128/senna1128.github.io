abstract: "
Online algorithms gain prominence as the volume of data explodes, among which second-order methods are known for their robustness. While much research focuses on the convergence of stochastic second-order methods, the algorithms' variability remains underexplored. This paper studies the statistical inference of the estimates generated by an inexact adaptive stochastic Newton method. The algorithm not only allows adaptive stepsize, but also significantly reduces computational costs by inexactly solving the Newton systems with a randomized solver involving sketching techniques. For the designed algorithm, we establish the asymptotic normality of its last iterate and, more importantly, construct a fully online limiting covariance estimator. Our covariance estimator solely utilizes the iterates (with varying weights) from the stochastic Newton algorithm, which outperforms the plug-in estimator in terms of both consistency and computational efficiency. We establish the convergence rate of the weighted covariance estimator and illustrate its superior performance on regression problems.
