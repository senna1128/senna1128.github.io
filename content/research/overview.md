I was trained as a statistician during my Ph.D. studies, but my postdoctoral research has expanded to encompass other areas such as operations research, scientific computing, and industrial engineering. My research is rooted in the **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">mathematical foundations of data science</span>**, with a focus on high-dimensional statistics, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization, control theory, and scientific machine learning. My ultimate research goal is to develop next-generation **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">stochastic numerical methods</span>** with promising **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">statistical and computational efficiency</span>** in solving complex problems in statistics and engineering.

To achieve this, I develop practical methods by leveraging classical optimization techniques, such as exact penalty, augmented Lagrangian, trust region, active set, and interior-point methods. I revisit, reform, and redesign these techniques to address pressing modern challenges, including **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">scalability</span>**, **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">reliability</span>**, and **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">adaptivity</span>**.


Currently, my research focuses on the following topics:

* Constrained stochastic optimization 
* Statistical inference of stochastic second-order methods 
* Machine learning with physics-informed constraints 
* Stochastic real-time optimal control \& model predictive control 
* Semiparametric graphical models
