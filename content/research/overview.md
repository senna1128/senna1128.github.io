I was trained as a statistician during my Ph.D. studies, but my postdoctoral research has expanded to encompass other areas, such as operations research, scientific computing, and industrial engineering. My research is rooted in the **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">mathematical foundations of data science</span>**, with primary focuses on high-dimensional statistics, computational statistics, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization, and control. My ultimate research goal is to develop next-generation **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">stochastic numerical methods</span>** that exhibit promising **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">statistical and computational efficiency</span>** in solving various problems in **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">scientific machine learning</span>**. These problems include scalable and reliable energy systems, safe reinforcement learning, physics-informed networks, algorithmic fairness, and more.


To achieve this, my research bridges modern statistics and classical optimization with a particular emphasis on various **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">constraints</span>** and **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">uncertainties</span>**. I develop practical methods by leveraging classical techniques from applied mathematics and numerical optimization, such as exact penalty, augmented Lagrangian, trust region, active set, and interior-point methods. I revisit, reform, and redesign these techniques to adapt them to special structures in modern statistical and decision-making problems, finally enabling me to address critical challenges such as **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">scalability</span>**, **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">reliability</span>**, and **<span style="color: rgb(51,133,255);">adaptivity</span>**.


Currently, my research focuses on the following concrete topics:

* Constrained stochastic optimization 
* Statistical inference of stochastic second-order methods 
* Machine learning with physics-informed constraints 
* Stochastic real-time optimal control \& model predictive control 
* Semiparametric graphical models
