I am currently a postdoc in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) and [International Computer Science Institute (ICSI)](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/) at UC Berkeley, working with [Michael W. Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/).

I received my Ph.D. degree in statistics from the University of Chicago in 2021, under the supervision of [Mihai Anitescu](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~anitescu/) and [Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/). Before attending UChicago, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics from Nanjing University in 2016. I was also very fortunate to visit the Statistics department at UC Davis and work with [Jane-Ling Wang](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~wang/), [Hans-Georg Müller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/), and [Christiana Drake](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~drake/) in 2015.

I am broadly interested in the mathematical foundation of data science, including high-dimensional statistics, graphical models, semiparametric models, optimal control, and large-scale and stochastic nonlinear optimization. I am also interested in the applications of machine learning methods in biology, neuroscience, and engineering.
