I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. Prior to joining ISyE, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) and [International Computer Science Institute (ICSI)](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/) at UC Berkeley, working with [Michael W. Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/).

I received my Ph.D. degree in statistics from the University of Chicago in 2021, under the supervision of [Mihai Anitescu](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~anitescu/) and [Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/). Before attending UChicago, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics from Nanjing University in 2016. I also visited the Statistics department at UC Davis as an exchange student and worked with [Jane-Ling Wang](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~wang/), [Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/), and [Christiana Drake](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~drake/) in 2015.

I am broadly interested in the mathematical foundations of data science, with topics including high-dimensional statistics, graphical models, semiparametric models, optimal control, and large-scale and stochastic nonlinear optimization. I am also interested in the applications of machine learning methods in biology, neuroscience, and engineering.

**<span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">(I'm actively seeking graduate students who are interested in interdisciplinary research in statistics, optimization, and data science.<br/> * GT students can send me an email with CV and transcript.<br/> * Prospective students should apply directly to our PhD or Master's programs and mention my name in the application.)</span>**
